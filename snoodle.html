                                <p>My starting point to find a solution for this problem was to try and learn about the habits of people searching on the web for information, what are the different aspects and what is trending. By doing secondary research ; Ad business a boom for Amazon, but a turn-off for shoppers Mike Maddaloni went to amazon.com knowing exactly what he wanted to buy. But instead of showing him the Synology router  he was searching for at the top of the results, Amazon bombarded him with adds for hard drives and routers that he didn’t want. Maddaloni, a web strategist in Appleton, Wisconsin, said searching of the worlds shopping site had always a good experience for him, until a month ago, when he started seeing more ads. Amazon has turned its online store into an advertising powerhouse in just a few years, it overtook microsoft last year as the third largest ad platform, in the United States following Google and facebook. According to the market research  firm  eMarketer. That’s mostly due to Amazon’s search bar: Most shoppers now go to Amazon, first instead of Google to look up products according to Jumpshot, which tracks online shopping behavior. The downside to Amazon booming ad business is the impact on the user experience . Companies and brands can bid to get their products in Amazon's search listings, sometimes pushing down what shoppers are really searching for and making them harder to find. It risks betraying Amazon’s customer friendly reputation and irritating shoppers like Maddaloni, who are used to Amazon being the place they go to find what they want to buy quickly. Jason Goldberg, a retail Consultant and chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Communications, said showing ads instead of what people search for is “the best example of Amazon failing to live up to its Mission of becoming earth's most customer centric company. “That's clearly not in the shoppers best interest,” he said.  The company said its sponsored ads are a way for Customers to find products they may be interested in. And it uses Machine-learning  technology to try and show ads that are relevant to shoppers BUT THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN. A perfect example is :- </p>

                                After David Sinclair’s book on aging went on sale in September, colleagues told him that when they typed his name on Amazon, they saw ads for vitamins and supplements above his book. The supplement makers had selected Sinclair’s name as a keyword, hoping to get the attention of people who wanted to buy his book, “Lifespan: Why We Age — and Why We Don’t Have To.” 
</p>
<p>He tweeted a warning to his followers: “If you search for me on Amazon right now, you may first have to scroll past some sponsored ads for supplements. This is not my doing. I do not endorse products.”</p>
<p>The Harvard Medical School professor said the supplement ads made it look like he was somehow linked to the pills, which he is not.</p>
<p>“That’s my reputation at stake,” Mr. Sinclair said.</p>
<p>After The Associated Press asked about the vitamin ads, Amazon said it wasn’t a good customer experience and removed them.  Credits AP</p>

 Hey thank you for taking some time to assist me with this project. Here is a prototype of the app, I told you about, that I was working on. I would like to test the prototype with you, and it won't take much time. I just want to see if this app will enhance people's lives and work as intended,  I will ask you to complete a couple tasks searching  using the app with its filter feature  and that will be all. </p>

                                In order to conduct my usability test amongst potential users, I would upload my prototype to the sketch cloud, and share it with test users on their wireless devices where the prototype is animated then I would use  skype to observe, these potential users as they did a task on the Snooodle app. </p><p>
                                After I designed the first prototype in sketch, that designed changed many times, to this final design around the user experience, during multiple usability testing sessions. Users were tested using the prototype animated in invision on the iphone platform, for pain points and unaccomplished tasks, users were observed and interviewed using a usability script and gathering that data on a usability session notes. Below is the final Prototype from usability testing. This final product, was finalized and centered around the user experience with  the Snooodle app.

                              At first, I did not have a clear understanding of user goals and what motivates them. After using the various usability techniques. I designed the app around the user experience and from the insights of user personas. While doing this test, I found out that many college students were having a pain point with the current search platforms. What they told me was for a research paper to be credible they would need secondary research papers from org, edu and gov. With the snooodle search app, would provide a simple way to gather source information for their research papers and in addition, the search would keep searching for more information, even after the initial search to add more credibility to their school work at college. The Snooodle app, is now designed to enhance people’s lives, and make  the search experience more customized for the user, centered around the user experience.

                               Being competitive in an already crowded market with big players like Google , Bing and yahoo.  My approach was to remain focused on what was missing from the already existing apps and to overlap their features.

<p>I continued the discovery phase with a usability heuristic analysis. I used Norman & Nielsen rules of thumb for good interaction design to learn more about competitors and understand where their strengths and weaknesses were to create a superior product. </p>

                               I selected the following areas as most important for the evaluation:
                               <p><strong>The problem, I set out to solve in my capstone project; Is when you forget one essential item at the grocery store, what do you do now, what are your options? </strong>></p>
                               <p>I found that none of these apps, provided a customized search fort the users, all results were based on an algorithm and advertising paid for by adwords, making search very commercial. The Snooodle app had all 10 usability heuristic designs, including the minimalistic approach and all of the below.</p>
                               <p><strong>Nielson Norman Group’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design.</strong></p>
                               <p><strong>Visibility of system status</strong> <br>
                                The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                <strong>Match between system and the real world</strong> <br>
The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
                                </p>

                               <p>
                               <strong> User control and freedom</strong> <br>
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                               <strong> Consistency and standards </strong> <br>
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                               <strong> Error prevention </strong> <br>
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                               <strong> Recognition rather than recall </strong> <br>
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                               <strong> Flexibility and efficiency of use </strong> <br>
Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                               <strong> Aesthetic and minimalist design </strong> <br>
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                               <strong> Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors </strong> <br>
                                Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                               <strong> Help and documentation </strong> <br>
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
                                </p>

<p>“When you understand what motivates or disillusions a person, you can build designs that will persuade your users to engage with your product in a way that either helps your business (this is known as conversion), helps themselves, or both.”</p>
<p>Psychology plays a big part in a user’s experience with an application. By understanding how our designs are perceived, we can make adjustments so that the apps we create are more effective in achieving the goals of the user.</p>
<p>Von Restorff effect; The Von Restorff effect (also known as the isolation effect) predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered! </p>
<p>This is the main reason why all call-to-actions (CTAs) look different from the rest of the action buttons on a site or application! We want users to be able to differentiate between a simple action button and a CTA, in order for them to have a clear understanding what the CTA does, whilst also remembering </p>
<p>“When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered!” </p>


<p>The next loop of User Experience is about designing for persuasion, emotion, and trust. You still need good usability, but it’s often not enough to design a website that is easy to understand, navigate, and interact. Just because people can do something does not guarantee that they will — they must be motivated and persuaded to make decisions that lead to conversion. PET Design is rooted in social psychology and it’s pioneered by Human Factors Inc. It complements classic usability and user experience best practices. No sensory overload screens were also detected on this toogthr app. </p>

                              The Serial Position Effect is the propensity of a user to best remember the first and last items in a series. This is why most applications nowadays ditch the hamburger menu and go for a bottom or top bar navigation, placing the most important user actions to the right or left. In the image above, you can see some examples from popular iOS applications. Each put the “Home” and “Profile” items all the way to the left and right, with serial position effect in mind.</p>
                              <p>For example most of the time on applications’ empty states, we prompt users to complete a task. Here, the copy needs to be short, simple and with the appropriate words in order for the user to be able to easily follow the instructions.</p>
